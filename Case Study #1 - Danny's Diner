-- Example Query:

-- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

SELECT s.customer_id, sum(m.price) AS total_spent 
FROM dannys_diner.sales s 
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;


-- 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) as days
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY days DESC;

-- 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

SELECT prod_id.customer_id, m.product_name as first_item
FROM (SELECT customer_id, product_id 
FROM (SELECT customer_id, product_id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS row_number
FROM dannys_diner.sales) row_num
WHERE row_num.row_number=1
ORDER BY customer_id) prod_id 
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
ON prod_id.product_id = m.product_id;


-- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

SELECT m.product_name, COUNT(m.product_name) AS item_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m

GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY item_count DESC
